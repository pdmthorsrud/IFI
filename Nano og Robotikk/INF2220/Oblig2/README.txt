1. Run javac *.java in terminal
2. Oblig2.java includes the main method
3. The assumption that I didn't need to implement something that takes care of the command 'java Oblig2 <projectName>.txt manpower'
because I did not do any of the optional tasks. My program can be run as the command above, but by leaving out the 'manpower' part.
4. Two versions of findEarliestStart (one is called findEarliestStart, the other findEarliestStartAlt). 
Simply left the one I haven't used commented out.
5. Everything works as it should.
6. My searchForLoop is heavily influenced by the DFS from the foils used in the graphs 2 lecture.
