* TODO Module 3
** TODO Question 1
   - What does it mean to say that a social concept is embodied? 
   Compare the idea of modal mental representations to the idea of amodal mental representations in associative networks. 
   Illustrate this with an example.
*** Stikkord
    - 
    
** TODO Question 2
   - How could modal representations develop? Describe at least 2 different accounts, and name examples of embodied concepts for each
*** DONE Stikkord
    1) Grounded cognition
       - mental representations are all grounded in bodily morphology
       - All aspects of psychological processes are influenced by some degree by our real life world
    2) Explain modal representations
       - We can say that the embodiment framework assumes how we analyze and react to a situation must take into account our bodily abilities.
       - They remain in your head as physical, and no matter what, you can relate this to the real world vs associative network 
    3) Direct experience: development of schemas where we connect something new to 
       already existing modal representations. Butterfly: an insect, small, flys, etc.
       - Eple erfaring
       - Judgement (example of how direct experiences are used to connect it to something
	 completely abstract, and develop a modal representation of it)
    4) metaphoric mapping: developed by having no direct experience or anything to link an abstract concept
       up against. Therefore we use linguistic metaphors to explain something completely abstract
       - Use example of time mapped into our spatial dimensions
       - Also use smell example, Lee and Schwarz found that smell influences suspicion
    5) inherited association: got no fucking clue (yet), considering to just leave it out, and explain metaphoric and direct
