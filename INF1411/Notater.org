  - Q(charge) = number of electrons/6.25*e18 electrons/C
  - Kirchoffs spenningslow: the sum of all the voltage drops around a single closed path in a circuit is equals to the total srouce voltage in that closed path
  - Kirchoffs strømlov: The sum of the currents into a node is equal to the sum of the currents out of that node

   - Coloumbs law: A force (F) exists between two point-source charges (Q1, Q2) that is directly proportional to the product of the two charges
     and inviresely proportional to the square of the distance (d) between the charges

   - V = W/Q
   - In a practical DC signal the signal will decrease slightly after some time
   - Battery: converts chemical energy directly into electrical energy

   - Current: rate of flow of charge
   - One ampere: The amount of current that exists when a number of electrons having a total charge of one coulomb move through a given cross-section area in once second
   - in practical current source the signal will decrease slightly after some time

   - Rise time: is the time required for the pulse to go from 10% of its amplitucde to 90% of its amplitude
   - Fall time: is the time required for the pulse to go from 90% of its amplutde to 10% of its amplitude
   - Pulse width: the time between the point on the leading edge where the value is 50% of the amplitude and the point on the trailing edge where the value is 50% of the amplitude
